# Performance Optimizations Applied

## Problem
Website was taking 5+ minutes to load on first visit due to:
- Multiple sequential GitHub API calls
- Image validation requests for each project
- No caching strategy
- Blocking external resources
- No lazy loading

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Resource Preloading & DNS Prefetch** (index.html)
- Added `preconnect` for Google Fonts and CDNs
- Added `dns-prefetch` for GitHub API and raw.githubusercontent.com
- Loads Font Awesome asynchronously to prevent render blocking

### 2. **Request Timeouts** (projects.js)
- Added 5-second timeout for all fetch requests
- Prevents hanging on slow API responses
- Uses AbortController for proper timeout handling

### 3. **Eliminated Image Validation Requests** (projects.js)
- Removed the loop that tried multiple image URLs
- Now uses custom images directly or GitHub's OpenGraph API
- Saves 5-10 requests per project

### 4. **Extended Cache Duration** (projects.js)
- Increased cache from 2 hours to 24 hours
- Reduces API calls on subsequent visits
- Added fallback data in project config

### 5. **Lazy Loading Projects** (projects.js)
- Projects only load when user scrolls near the section
- Uses Intersection Observer API
- Starts loading 200px before section enters viewport
- Saves initial page load time dramatically

### 6. **Better Error Handling** (projects.js)
- Uses Promise.allSettled instead of Promise.all
- One failed project won't break all projects
- Graceful fallbacks with project config data

### 7. **Optimized Fallback Data** (projects.js)
- Added default stars/forks/description to project configs
- Fallback method is now synchronous (no async overhead)
- Uses project config data when API fails

## Expected Results

### First Visit (No Cache)
- **Before**: 5+ minutes
- **After**: 2-5 seconds (projects load when scrolled to)

### Subsequent Visits (With Cache)
- **Before**: 30-60 seconds
- **After**: Instant (all data from cache)

### After 24 Hours (Cache Expired)
- Projects will refresh in background
- Still fast due to timeouts and optimizations

## How to Test

1. Clear browser cache and localStorage
2. Open the website
3. Page should load immediately (hero section visible)
4. Scroll down - projects will load as you approach that section
5. Refresh page - everything should be instant (cached)

## Maintenance Notes

- Cache expires after 24 hours
- If GitHub API is rate-limited, fallback data from config is used
- Custom images are always preferred over API fetches
- All network requests have 5-second timeout
